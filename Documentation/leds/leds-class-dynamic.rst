======================================
Dynamic Lighting LED class under Linux
======================================

Author: Marco Scardovi <scardracs@disroot.org>

Description
===========
The Dynamic Lighting LED class provides a standardized sysfs interface for
complex, addressable illumination hardware such as per-key RGB keyboard
matrices, 2D LED matrix displays, addressable segment strips, and chassis
lightbars.

The Dynamic Lighting class wraps the standard Linux LED class framework,
providing a unified sysfs ABI for hardware effects, stacked palette
configuration, power state persistence, and high-throughput binary frame
streaming without requiring raw character device access from userspace.

Directory Layout Example
========================
The following examples use ``<led>`` as a placeholder for a Dynamic Lighting
LED class device name.

Sysfs Attributes
================

``zone_type`` (read-only)
    Driver-defined string describing the physical topology of the zone.
    Example values include ``generic``, ``keyboard``, ``keyboard_per_key``,
    ``matrix_2d``, ``segment_strip``, ``logo``, ``lightbar``, or ``global``.

``led_count`` (read-only)
    Total number of individually addressable LEDs in this zone.

``matrix_dimensions`` (read-only)
    Width and height for 2D matrix layouts formatted as ``<width> <height>``.
    Only visible when the driver publishes non-zero matrix dimensions.

``effect_index`` (read-only)
    Space-separated list of animation effect names supported by the hardware
    (not numeric indices). Names include: ``off``, ``static``, ``breathing``,
    ``strobe``, ``spectrum_cycle``, ``rainbow``, ``direct``, and ``custom``.

``effect`` (read/write)
    Currently active hardware animation effect. Writing a supported effect name
    switches the mode. Any active trigger is automatically detached upon effect
    change to eliminate lock conflicts.

``speed_range`` (read-only)
    Minimum and maximum effect animation speed accepted by ``speed``. Only visible
    when the hardware supports adjustable speed.

``speed`` (read/write)
    Current effect animation speed (within ``speed_range``). Only visible when the
    hardware supports adjustable speed.

``direction_index`` (read-only)
    Space-separated list of directions accepted by ``direction``. Only
    visible when directional effects are supported.

``direction`` (read/write)
    Animation propagation direction: ``left``, ``right``, ``up``, ``down``,
    ``clockwise``, or ``counter_clockwise``. Only visible when directional
    effects are supported.

``max_palette_entries`` (read-only)
    Maximum number of palette entries accepted by ``effects_palette``. Only
    visible when programmable palettes are supported.

``effects_palette`` (read/write)
    Space-separated list of 24-bit RGB hex colors (e.g. ``#ff0000 #00ff00``).
    Up to ``max_palette_entries`` colors can be defined.

``power_states_index`` (read-only)
    List of platform power states supported for illumination persistence
    (``boot``, ``awake``, ``sleep``, ``shutdown``).

``power_states`` (read/write)
    Currently active persistence states. Writing a space-separated list of
    state names idempotently updates the active state bitmask.

``direct_buffer`` (write-only, binary)
    Raw binary sink for streaming per-key RGB frames. Each LED requires 3 bytes
    in sequence (R, G, B). The write must start at offset 0 and the buffer size
    must equal ``led_count * 3`` bytes. Enables efficient high-rate streaming
    for visualizers and canvas sinks.

``frame`` (write-only, binary)
    Raw binary sink for monochrome display chunks (e.g. 2D pixel matrices) or
    segmented lighting bars. The current ABI only accepts writes starting at
    offset 0; each write is forwarded to the driver as one frame payload and
    must not exceed the size published on the binary attribute (at most 65536
    bytes).

Locking Hierarchy & Invariants
==============================
To prevent kernel deadlocks between LED triggers, sysfs handlers, and bus
transfers, the subsystem enforces the following lock order:

1. Acquire outer mutex: ``mutex_lock(&cdev->led_access)``.
2. If the operation replaces trigger-driven output, disengage/remove the active
   LED trigger via ``led_trigger_remove(cdev)``.
3. Acquire internal mutex: ``mutex_lock(&ldev->lock)``.
4. Validate inputs, update state, and dispatch driver callbacks.
5. Release internal mutex: ``mutex_unlock(&ldev->lock)``.
6. Release outer mutex: ``mutex_unlock(&cdev->led_access)``.

Driver callbacks must not persist class-owned fields (``current_effect``,
``speed``, palette, ``active_power_states``) on failure; the core writes those
fields only after a successful callback. ``brightness_set_blocking`` is not
called with ``ldev->lock`` held and must take it if it mutates the same state.

``frame`` writes are rejected when the payload is empty, not at offset 0, or
larger than the driver-advertised ``max_frame_size`` (capped at 65536 bytes).

Examples
========

-----------------------------------------
.. code-block:: console

    # echo "breathing" > /sys/class/leds/<led>/effect
    # echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/<led>/speed

-------------------------------------
.. code-block:: console

    # echo "#ff0000 #00ff00 #0000ff" > /sys/class/leds/<led>/effects_palette

Enabling illumination during boot and awake states:
---------------------------------------------------
.. code-block:: console

    # echo "boot awake" > /sys/class/leds/<led>/power_states

Streaming a direct RGB frame (for a 168-LED device, 504 bytes):
----------------------------------------------------------------
.. code-block:: console

    # dd if=/dev/urandom of=/sys/class/leds/<led>/direct_buffer bs=504 count=1
